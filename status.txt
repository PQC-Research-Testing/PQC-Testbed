The following Implementations have been successfully run:
    -HAWK
    -MQOM
    -PERK
    -QR_UOV
    -ryde
    -SDitH
    -SNOVA 
    -UOV (Appears to function for AMD64 option, can't see raw rsp and req files only builtin tester results)
    -MAYO 
    -FAEST (Additiona Implementation could be run not Reference though)

The following Implementations require linking binaries:
    -CROSS (Successfully using Additional Implementation Version)
    -SQIsign (Successfully run, though appears better performance requires 'assertions' to be disabled? They weren't lying it do affect the performance!)
    -LESS (Successfully run)

It appears most implementations have their own benchmarking function, need to look into standardizing it across them
for our own testing. Most seem to track performance in CPU cycles, should look into tracking RAM usage and other 
metrics. 

Updating Algorithms to their Round 2 Variants has been somewhat difficult due to some not being publicly available:

The following implementations could be upgraded to their Round 2 Variants:
    -LESS
    -CROSS
    -SQIsign
    -PERK
    -RYDE 
    -MAYO
    -QRUOV
    -SNOVA



The following implementations couldn't be upgraded to their Round 2 Variants:
    -HAWK
    -MQoM 
    -SDitH
    -FAEST (Appears to be undergoing development (last commit 6 hours ago 2/19/25))
